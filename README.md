# Monte-Carlo-Wealth-Simulator
A Python-based stochastic model for simulating long-term portfolio growth and success probabilities.

The Problem: Standard retirement calculators assume linear growth, ignoring market volatility.

The Solution: This model uses a Monte Carlo approach to simulate 1,000 market scenarios.

Key Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
